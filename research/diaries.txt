DIARY ENTRY #1 – BEFORE USING THE PRODUCT  
Tuesday, 11:47 p.m., home office lit only by the monitor’s ice-blue glow  

The house is finally quiet, but the silence feels like a stage waiting for my panic to perform. I’m still in the same oatmeal Everlane sweater I put on at 6:05 a.m.; the cuffs are stretched from me chewing on them all day. My pulse is doing that jack-rabbit thing again—thump-thump-thump behind my ears—because tomorrow at 9:03 a.m. (yes, the calendar invite says 9:03, not 9:00, as if those 180 seconds are a gift) I get exactly twenty-seven minutes with Olivia—VP of Product, ruler of promotion lists, collector of quick-sync scalps.  

The Zoom link sits in my inbox like a loaded staple gun. I keep clicking it open, then closing it, as if the URL itself will change and give me an escape hatch. My stomach is a clenched fist of cold dough. I rehearse the first sentence:  
“Hi Olivia, excited to walk you through our Q3 north-star metric trajectory—”  
No, too robotic.  
“Hey Olivia, before we dive in, I wanted to get your pulse on—”  
Too needy.  
I can taste the metallic tang of my own indecision.  

I open the sticky-note wall on my monitor. There are seventeen notes, each a different color, each a different script. They look like confetti, but they feel like shrapnel. I drag them around until the screen blurs. Underneath the anxiety is this darker sludge—resentment. Resentment that I’m up at midnight rehearsing small talk while my kids’ preschool art dries on the wall behind me, macaroni glitter starting to peel like dead skin.  

I’m terrified that when Olivia’s face pops onto the screen, I’ll see that micro-expression she did last time—eyebrows lifting a millimeter, the silent “Oh, this again?” I’ll ramble, she’ll check her phone, and I’ll leave the call with another polite “Let’s dive deeper next time,” which is corporate speak for “You bored me.”  

My throat is raw from unsaid words. I swallow, and it feels like gulping thumbtacks. The ceiling fan clicks every third rotation—click, click, click—matching the countdown in my head. I whisper to the dark room:  
“What does she actually care about this quarter?”  
The fan answers with silence. My reflection in the black monitor looks like a hostage.

DIARY ENTRY #2 – DURING FIRST USE OF PRODUCT  
Wednesday, 7:14 a.m., kitchen counter, coffee steaming like a dragon’s sigh  

I’m still in my robe—flannel, coffee-stained, sleeves rolled to the elbow because my hands are shaking. Yesterday’s call went the way I feared: twenty-seven minutes of polite nodding, zero follow-up. I couldn’t sleep, so at 3:12 a.m. I rage-googled “how to read VPs’ minds” and landed on this microservice promising to decode Olivia from her LinkedIn breadcrumbs. The free trial banner glowed like an exit sign.  

I paste Olivia’s profile URL into the box—my finger hovers over Enter like I’m defusing a bomb. One click. The screen blooms open: a soft indigo dashboard, gentle sans-serif, almost…kind. My heartbeat slows, curious.  

First insight: “Olivia processes information visually—prefers Miro boards over slide decks.”  
A tiny spark in my chest, like a match struck in a cave.  

Second: “Values efficiency; open with direct reports who bring 3-option trade-offs.”  
I exhale—actually exhale—as if someone just loosened the corset around my ribs.  

Third: “Avoids small talk; her fastest rapport-builder is asking about weekend mountain-bike rides.”  
I glance at the sticky-note wall. The seventeen neon squares suddenly look garish, clownish. I peel them off one by one; they make a soft shhh sound as they release. Underneath, the monitor glows with a generated meeting agenda:  
1. 60-second context anchor (data visual)  
2. 3-option trade-off on roadmap sequencing  
3. Close with mountain-bike trail recommendation (Dupont State Forest, moderate climb)  

A warmth spreads through me, foreign and addictive—like stepping from February wind into direct sunlight. I catch my reflection in the toaster: eyes wide, not hostage-wide, but explorer-wide.  

I whisper, testing the words:  
“Olivia, I built a quick Miro canvas to show three sequencing scenarios—mind if I screenshare?”  
The sentence feels sleek, aerodynamic. My voice doesn’t crack.  

I hit “Export PDF,” and the file lands in my downloads with a satisfying clunk. I imagine tomorrow’s call: Olivia leaning forward, pupils dilating at the Miro colors, her mouth twitching into the half-smile she reserves for ideas that delight her. For the first time in weeks, my stomach unknots enough to let me sip coffee without tasting acid.

DIARY ENTRY #3 – AFTER USING THE PRODUCT  
Friday, 9:52 p.m., backyard chaise lounge under a spill of stars  

The air smells of cut grass and charcoal; my daughter’s laughter still echoes from inside where she’s baking banana bread with my husband. I’m barefoot, legs stretched long, robe traded for a soft Lululemon hoodie that finally feels like comfort instead of armor.  

This morning’s call with Olivia lasted thirty-four minutes—seven bonus minutes because she said, “Let’s keep going; this is useful.” Thirty-four minutes that felt like flying. She screenshotted my Miro board. She asked which trail I recommended for beginners because her partner wants to start riding. She ended with, “Maya, you’re thinking at the right altitude. Let’s sync again in two weeks—bring the next set of trade-offs.”  

I open the microservice dashboard on my phone. The relationship tracker now shows Olivia’s dot moving from pale yellow (“aware”) to amber (“engaged”). I watch the color deepen in real time, like watching sunrise paint a wall. A notification pops: “Suggested follow-up: share Strava segment from Dupont ride, light humor.” I smile—my cheeks actually ache from smiling.  

The dominant negative emotions that lived in my throat like burrs—anxiety, impostor syndrome, resentment—feel…gone. Evaporated. In their place is this buoyant calm, a kind of inner weather I’ve never owned before. I breathe in; the night air tastes sweet, almost celebratory.  

I journal by phone-light:  
“Today I didn’t perform; I connected. The algorithm didn’t make me robotic—it gave me the human cheat codes I was too exhausted to find.”  

I close the app and tilt my head back. The stars look close enough to pocket. Somewhere inside, the old fear whispers, “Fluke.” But it’s faint, a ghost in the attic. I answer it aloud, voice steady:  
“Not a fluke. A system.”  

The fan inside the house clicks once—same fan, same third rotation—but now it sounds like applause.
