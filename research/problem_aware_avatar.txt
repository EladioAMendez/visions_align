D → Smart Market Questions  
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling: “I have exactly 27 minutes with the VP of Product next Tuesday and if I don’t make it count I’ll be stuck at this level for another year.”  
What are they secretly afraid of in life: That she’s actually a mediocre communicator who’s been hiding behind polished slide decks.  
What are they angry about, and who are they angry at: Angry that the “old boys’ club” still gets informal face time on golf courses she’s never invited to; angry at herself for not mastering small talk.  
Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:  
1. Calendar Tetris—every minute is scheduled but the meetings feel shallow.  
2. Slack pings interrupting deep work right when she’s synthesizing customer insights.  
3. Senior leaders who say “My door is always open” but whose calendars are triple-booked.  
Biggest secret desire in life: To be recognized as the strategic glue that turns disparate teams into product legends—without having to become an extrovert.  
Built-in bias to how they make decisions: If the approach is backed by data and framed as an experiment, she’ll try it—even if it feels awkward.  
Common words or language unique to them: “North-star metric,” “runway,” “blended org health score,” “time-boxed,” “async-first.”  
Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:  
1. Generic “executive presence” coaches give advice that feels scripted and male-coded.  
2. LinkedIn Premium’s insights are too high-level (“works at Google, went to Stanford”)—zero nuance.  
3. Internal mentorship programs pair her with peers instead of decision-makers.  

E → Going Deep  
Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions: Anxiety (pre-meeting dread), Impostor syndrome flare-ups, Resentment (at uneven playing field)  
Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem: Calm confidence walking into exec meetings, Pride when leaders proactively seek her input, Relief at predictable career momentum  
Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:  
1. Relationships compound faster than code.  
2. Data beats charisma—but only if you can communicate it.  
3. Remote work rewards those who master asynchronous influence.  
Biggest Lifestyle Desire: A 32-hour workweek by age 40 without sacrificing trajectory or compensation.  

F → Purchasing Habits  
Top 3 Decision Triggers: Free trial that shows immediate ROI, peer testimonial from another woman in tech, transparent usage metrics (credits consumed vs. insights gained)  
Prior Purchases For This Pain: Reforge membership ($2,000), “Presence Under Pressure” webinar bundle ($297), Calendly Professional ($144/yr)  
Price Tolerance For Offer: Up to $50/month if it demonstrably shortens path to promotion; will expense to L&D budget  
Time Horizon Of Solution: Wants actionable guidance within 48 hours of next key meeting  

G → Primary Wants  
Wants to gain: A repeatable system for turning 30-minute exec touchpoints into sponsorship relationships  
Wants to be: Perceived as indispensable strategic thought-partner, not just deliverer of roadmaps  
Wants to do: Walk into every VP conversation with a custom agenda that feels effortless and authentic  
Wants to save: Emotional energy—stop rehearsing 10 versions of the same update in her head at 2 a.m.  
Wants to avoid: Being labeled “brilliant but not quite leadership material” in calibration meetings  

H → Empathy Map  
Seeing: Calendar invites labeled “Quick Sync – 30 min” from VP of Product; unread Slack threads from engineers; kids’ artwork taped to home-office wall  
Thinking: “What does this leader actually care about this quarter, and how do I connect my roadmap to that in one clear sentence?”  
Hearing: Exec voice saying “Love the energy—let’s dive deeper next time”; peers gossiping about who got visibility at the offsite; spouse reminding her to close the laptop at dinner  
Feeling: Heart racing when Zoom countdown hits 5 seconds; surge of hope when a senior leader retweets her product thread  
Saying: “I need to be more strategic,” “Let’s align on outcomes,” “I’ll circle back async”  
Doing: Color-coding stakeholder heat maps in Notion, bookmarking every VP’s podcast appearance, setting 15-min timer to rehearse a crisp narrative  

Maya knows her problem: limited face time with decision-makers is killing her momentum. She has tried brute-force preparation, but each leader’s quirks feel like a black box. She hasn’t yet discovered that an AI microservice can decode LinkedIn footprints into a bespoke meeting playbook—she only senses that the current scattershot approach isn’t sustainable.
